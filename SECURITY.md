# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take security seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to me as described below.

### Reporting Process

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for the vulnerability.
2. Contact me directly via:
   - LinkedIn: [Ugur Koc](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ugurkocde/)
   - You can reach out through LinkedIn's messaging system first, and we can establish a secure communication channel if needed.

### What to Include in Your Report

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- System/environment where the vulnerability was discovered
- Version affected

## Scope

### In Scope

- Code execution vulnerabilities
- Authentication and authorization issues
- Configuration issues that may lead to security problems
- Data exposure vulnerabilities

### Out of Scope

- Issues that require physical access to the user's system
- Issues in versions that are no longer supported

## Security Best Practices for Users

1. Always download from the official GitHub repository
2. Review the code before execution
3. Keep your environment up to date
