## 📋 Prerequisites

### Required PowerShell Modules
- PowerShell 7.0 or higher
- Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK
  - Specifically Microsoft.Graph.Authentication

### Required Permissions
Your Entra ID application registration needs these permissions:
| Permission | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| User.Read.All | Application | Read all users' full profiles |
| Group.Read.All | Application | Read all groups |
| Device.Read.All | Application | Read all devices |
| DeviceManagementApps.Read.All | Application | Read Microsoft Intune apps |
| DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All | Application | Read Microsoft Intune device configuration and policies |
| DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All | Application | Read Microsoft Intune devices |

## 🔐 Authentication Options

### Option 1: Certificate-Based Authentication (Recommended for automation)
Follow these steps if you want to use certificate authentication with an app registration:

1. Create an Entra ID App Registration:
   - Navigate to Azure Portal > Entra ID > App Registrations
   - Click "New Registration"
   - Name your application (e.g., "IntuneAssignmentChecker")
   - Select "Accounts in this organizational directory only"
   - Click "Register"

2. Grant required Application permissions:
   - In your app registration, go to "API Permissions"
   - Click "Add a permission" > "Microsoft Graph"
   - Select "Application permissions"
   - Add all required permissions listed in Prerequisites
   - Click "Grant admin consent"

3. Create and configure certificate authentication:
   ```powershell
   # Create self-signed certificate
   New-SelfSignedCertificate `
       -Subject "CN=IntuneAssignmentChecker" `
       -CertStoreLocation "cert:\CurrentUser\My" `
       -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(2) `
       -KeySpec Signature `
       -KeyExportPolicy Exportable

   # Export the certificate
   $cert = Get-ChildItem Cert:\CurrentUser\My | Where-Object {$_.Subject -like "*IntuneAssignmentChecker*"}
   Export-Certificate -Cert $cert -FilePath "C:\temp\IntuneAssignmentChecker.cer"
   ```

4. Upload certificate to your app registration:
   - In Azure Portal, go to your app registration
   - Click "Certificates & secrets"
   - Select "Certificates"
   - Click "Upload certificate"
   - Upload the .cer file you exported (C:\temp\IntuneAssignmentChecker.cer)

5. Configure the script with your app details:
   ```powershell
   # Update these values in the script
   $appid = '<YourAppIdHere>'           # Application (Client) ID
   $tenantid = '<YourTenantIdHere>'     # Directory (Tenant) ID
   $certThumbprint = '<YourThumbprint>' # Certificate Thumbprint
   ```

### Option 2: Interactive Authentication (Simpler setup)
If you prefer not to set up an app registration, you can use interactive authentication:

You can just run the script without any changes. It will ask if you want to use interactive authentication where you will type "y" and press enter.

This will prompt you to sign in with your credentials when running the script. The permissions will be based on your user account's roles and permissions in Entra ID.

### Which Option Should I Choose?

- **Choose Certificate Authentication if you**:
  - Need to run the script unattended
  - Want to automate the process
  - Need consistent permissions regardless of user
  - Are comfortable with more complex setup

- **Choose Interactive Authentication if you**:
  - Want a simpler setup
  - Don't need automation
  - Are comfortable using your user credentials
  - Only need to run the script occasionally

> **Note**: Keep your certificate and app credentials secure! Anyone with access to these can access your Intune environment with the configured permissions.
